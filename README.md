# glibco

## Introduction
The `glibco` module provides a comprehensive framework for efficient memory management, coroutine handling, task scheduling, and system call hooking in C++. It is designed to enhance performance in applications that require dynamic stack management and lightweight concurrency, particularly in network-related scenarios.

## Feature
The `glibco` module supports the following main features:

- **Memory Management**: Efficient allocation and deallocation of memory using custom memory pools.
- **Coroutine Handling**: Lightweight coroutine management for concurrent execution, suitable for network applications.
- **Task Scheduling**: Scheduling tasks using a time wheel mechanism for efficient execution timing.
- **System Call Hooking**: Intercepting and modifying system calls, particularly for socket operations, to facilitate debugging and monitoring.

## Implementation
The implementation of the `glibco` module is organized into several key code files and submodules:

- **Code Files**:
  - `bitmap_stackpool.hpp`, `linker_stackpool.hpp`: Memory management utilities.
  - `gcoroutine.hpp`: Coroutine handling using Boost.Context.
  - `multithread_scheduler.hpp`: Integrates coroutine management.
  - `scheduler.hpp`: Manages scheduling tasks with dependencies on `TimeWheel` and `MemoryManager`.
  - `hook.h`: Provides dynamic linking and memory protection utilities.

- **Submodules**:
  - **include**: Contains header files for various functionalities:

## Acknowledgement
This module utilizes the following third-party libraries:

- **Boost.Context**: A library that provides facilities for managing coroutines, enabling cooperative multitasking in C++ applications.
